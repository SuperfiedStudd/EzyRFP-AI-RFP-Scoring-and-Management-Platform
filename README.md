## Overview  
EzyRFP is an AI-powered Request for Proposal (RFP) management platform commissioned by **Meher Consulting** and developed to streamline vendor evaluation, automate scoring, and generate executive summaries within a unified interface.  
The platform demonstrates the integration of no-code development with OpenAI’s Assistant API to automate proposal analysis and decision support.

## Key Features  
• AI-generated vendor questions derived from RFP documents  
• Automated scoring with configurable question weightage  
• Executive summaries for each proposal  
• Leaderboard for vendor comparison
