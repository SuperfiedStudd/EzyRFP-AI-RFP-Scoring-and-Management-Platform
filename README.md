## 🧩 Overview  
EzyRFP is an AI-powered RFP management platform designed to streamline vendor evaluation, automate scoring, and generate executive summaries — all within a single interface.  

The project was commissioned by **Meher Consulting** and developed by **Jasjyot Singh**, showcasing the integration of no-code development with OpenAI’s Assistant API for automated proposal analysis.

## 🔍 Problem Statement  
Traditional RFP evaluation processes are manual, time-consuming, and prone to bias.  
EzyRFP automates the most repetitive and subjective parts of the process — from assigning vendors and collecting proposals to scoring and summarizing responses — cutting review time by up to 80%.

## 🧠 Key Features  
- AI-generated vendor questions based on RFP documents  
- Auto-scored vendor responses with question-level weightage  
- Executive summaries for each proposal  
- Overall comparison and leaderboard generation  
- Separate portals for Clients and Vendors
